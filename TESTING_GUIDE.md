## Debugging Tips

### If Charts Don't Show:

4. Refresh the page

### If Waste Classification Fails:
1. Check that input has text
2. Look at network tab - should POST to `/api/waste/classify`
3. Response should have `success: true`

### If OAuth Errors Don't Show:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that auth.js is loaded (Sources tab)
3. Look for console errors
